2.) Why do we use git and Github? Git allows multiple developers to

    service where the source code projects are stored.

3.) What is the general flow of git? git pull --> git add --> git commit -m --> git push <remote> <branch>

4.) What is the purpose of adding a remote to a local git repository? To pull and/or push code from a remote repository.

    created by enclosing the statements in curly braces.

8.) What is the idea of variable scope? Each time you start a new block, you are creating a new scope. A scope
    determines what objects are visible to other parts of your program. It also determines the lifetime of those objects.

9.) What are semicolons used for? They are used as separators to terminate a statement.

10.) What are lines of code indented? When should a line be indented? Lines of code are indented to make programs
     easily readable. Indent one level after each opening brace, and move back out one level after each closing brace.

11.) What does a .java file need to be complied to a .class file before running? The .class file contains the bytecode
     version of the program, which is not executable code. To run the program, you must use the Java interpreter, java.
