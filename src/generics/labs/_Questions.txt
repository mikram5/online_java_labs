Answer the following questions:

1.) Why do we use generics?
    Generics make programs more flexible.

2.) What is type erasure?
    Generic type parameters are replaced at compile time by Java. "E" will be replaced by "String" everywhere "E" is present.

3.) What is an example of a generic class that we have seen in the past?
    ArrayList

4.) Can an interface be generic?
    Yes, generic interfaces are specified just like generic classes

5.) What are bound and unbound generic types?
    Bounded generic types are used when you want your class or method to be generic,
    but still have some control of what data types can be used.
