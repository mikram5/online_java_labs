Answer the following questions:

1.) What is inheritance?
    When a sub-class extends a superclass. This means that a subclass inherits all the fields and methods from a superclass.

2.) Why do we use inheritance?
    When is class is able to be inherited, code can be reused in many places without having to worry about functional issues.

3.) Provide a real world example where you think inheritance would be implemented.
    A car manufacturer wants a program where each subclass (make of car) would inherit all members of the superclass 'Car'.

4.) How does a class inherit another class?
    The subclass extends a superclass when it's declared.

5.) How many levels can a hierarchy extend?
    There is no limit on inheritance levels.

6.) What is the "super" keyword used for?
    If a subclass's method overrides one of its superclass's methods, you can invoke the overridden method through the use of the keyword "super".

7.) When a subclass object is created, in what order do the constructors execute?
    The subclass constructor creates the subclass parts of the object and passes the rest to the superclass constructor.

8.) What is method overwriting?
    A parent class can define a method, and a child class can override the behavior of the parent class.
    To Override a method in a parent class, the child class must declare a method with the same exact return type, name and parameters.

9.) How can method overwriting be beneficial?
    In many cases child classes may need to use the same methods as their parent class, but they will need logic unique
    to their distinct class.
