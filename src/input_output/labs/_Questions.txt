    Programs use byte streams to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes.

2.) What is a character stream?
    Character streams handle the input and output of characters.


3.) What two classes are at the top of the the byte stream hierarchy?
    InputStream and OutputStream

4.) What two classes are at the top of the the character stream hierarchy?
    Reader and Writer

5.) List at least three byte stream classes.
    BufferedInputStream, FileInputStream, ObjectOutputStream

6.) List at least three character stream classes.
    BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, FileReader, FileWriter

7.) What is a try-with-resources?
    A version of the try statement that prevents situations in which a file is inadvertently not released after it
    is no longer needed.

8.) What makes the BufferedReader different from the BufferedInputStream?
    BufferedReader supports a buffered input character stream. BufferedInputStream supports a buffered byte stream.

9.) When would you use the read() method vs. the readline() method?
    read() reads a single byte from a file. readLine() reads a string from the keyboard.
