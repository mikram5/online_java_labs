    to extend the Thread class or implement the Runnable interface

3.) How do you start a thread using the Runnable interface?

4.) How do you start a thread using the Thread class?
    class ClassName extends Thread {

5.) How do you change a thread priority?
    You can set a thread's priority to a value between 1 (low) and 10 (high).
